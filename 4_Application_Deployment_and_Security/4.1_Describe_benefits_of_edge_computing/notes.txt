Edge Cloud
    -Edge cloud moves computing closer to where it’s needed
    -The edge cloud processes the data or transaction then either sends a response back to the client
    -It's important to note that at their heart, there is nothing "special" about edge clouds. They're just typical clouds. 
     What makes them "edge" is where they are, and that they're connected to each other.
    -Cisco's industrial networking products, such as routers, switches, and wireless access points, have integrated edge computing capabilities
    
    Examples
        -Another area where you may see edge computing is in retail, where you have multiple stores. Each store might have its own 
         internal cloud -- the edge cloud -- which feeds into the regional cloud, which in turn might feed into a central cloud. 
         This architecture gives local offices the benefits of having their own cloud (such as consistent deployment of APIs to ensure 
         each store can be managed, updated, and monitored efficiently).

        -Edge cloud moves computing closer to where it’s needed, so instead of transactions making their way from the end user 
         in, say, Cleveland, to the main cloud in, say, Oregon, there may be an intermediary cloud -- an edge cloud -- in Cleveland. 
         The edge cloud processes the data or transaction then either sends a response back to the client, or does preliminary analysis 
         of the data and sends the results on to a regional cloud that may be farther away.
