Firewalls
-At its most basic level, a firewall accepts or rejects packets based on the IP addresses and ports to which they're addressed.
-Firewalls don’t just keep traffic from coming in, they can also keep traffic from getting out.

Load Balancers
-Takes requests and “balances” them by spreading them out among multiple server
    -Persistent sessions: If an application requires a persistent session — for example, a user needs to be logged in — the load balancer will send requests to the server handling that session.
    -Round robin: With round robin load balancing, the server simply sends each request to the “next” server on the list.
    -Least connections: Often it makes sense to send requests to the server that’s least “busy”.
    -IP Hash: With this algorithm, the load balancer makes a decision based on a hash (an encoded value based on the IP address of the request). 
    You can think of this a something similar to when you attend an event and lines are formed for different stations based on the first letter in your last name.
    -More complicated methods for deployment purposes
        Blue-green deployment
            -A load balancer sends traffic to the blue environment when it's ready, and if issues arise, the load balancer can send traffic back to the green environment 
             and changes can be rolled back.
        Canary deployment
           -This deployment starts by diverting a small fraction of your traffic to the blue environment. A load balancer can then increase the amount of traffic diverted 
            to the blue environment until either issues are detected and traffic goes back to the old environment or all servers and users are on the new environment
DNS
    -how servers on the internet translate human-readable names such as developer.cisco.com or www.example.com into the machine-routable IP addresses such as 74.125.157.99 (for Google) 
     or 208.80.152.201 (for Wikipedia) that are necessary to actually navigate the internet.

Reverse Proxy
    -A reverse proxy works to make sure responses look like they all come from the same server.
    -A reverse proxy can evaluate traffic and act accordingly. In this way, it’s similar to — and can be used as — a firewall or a load balancer.
