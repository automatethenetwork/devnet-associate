On-Premises
    -Traditional data centers housing individual machines.
    -Provisioned for applications, rather than clouds, external or otherwise.
    -Classically takes a lot of work
    -Requests for resources need to go through the operations team, which can lead to delays
    -Scaling an application typically means moving it to a larger server, which makes scaling up or down a major event

Private Cloud
    -Clouds provide self-service access to computing resources, such as virtual machines, containers, and even bare metal
    -Users can log into a dashboard or use the command line to spin up new resources themselves.
    -These platforms are referred to as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
    -What distinguishes a private cloud from other types of clouds is that all resources within the cloud are under the 
     control of your organization.
Public Cloud
    -Managed by a public cloud provider
    -Share resources with other organizations: your virtual machine may run on the same host as a VM belonging to someone else.
    -Public cloud providers may (at a higher price) be able to provide customers with dedicated infrastructure
    -Most provide several geographically-separate cloud 'regions' in which workloads can be hosted.
    -Enabling jurisdictional control over where data is stored
    -You can scale up virtually indefinitely as long as the load requires it, then scale down when traffic is slow.
    -Don’t have to worry about maintaining or operating the hardware
    -May have to contend with situations in which other workloads take up more than their share of resources.
    -No control over the overcommitting of resources by provider

Hybrid Cloud
    -You might have an application that runs on your private cloud, but “bursts” to public cloud if it runs out of resources
    -Have an application that primarily runs on the public cloud, but uses resources in the private cloud for particular 
     purposes when security or control are an issue
    -What distinguishes hybrid cloud is the use of more than one cloud within a single application.

Edge Cloud
    -Edge cloud moves computing closer to where it’s needed
    -The edge cloud processes the data or transaction then either sends a response back to the client
    -It's important to note that at their heart, there is nothing "special" about edge clouds. They're just typical clouds. 
     What makes them "edge" is where they are, and that they're connected to each other.
